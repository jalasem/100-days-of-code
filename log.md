# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Embarked on a Journey to fix up my javascript fundamentals. Being realistic and honest to myself, I took a lot of drills at FCC to polish my skills and [here](freecodecamp/bonfire.md) is a little of those thing I learnt. I also made a [Boilerplate for Materializecss, ionicons, animatecss and fontawesome icon](https://github.com/jalasem/materializecss_starter) to make Material front-end design as easy and quick as possible.

**Thoughts:** It was kind of challenging at the beginning. Could'nt believe I lost my grip of the fundamentals but rihgt now I am gaining back my confidence grdaually. This is really amazing!!!.

**Today's Progress**: Continued on my drills at freecodecamp. I improved my Materializecss Starter by fixing bugs, adding samples and improved it's readme

**Thoughts**: I am loving this. I wish I had did this earlier before now!
